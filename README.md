# My Zmanim Widget
This is a WordPress plugin that will allow the admin to enter comments to appear on the user page.  Each comment includes a zman which is selected by the admin.
For Example "Today Shachris will be at (Sunrise).  
             Brachos will start 30 minutes beforehand."

I wrote this plugin as an exercise creating wordpress widget that accepts a variable number of input comments from the admin and displays them to the end user.  I also wanted to demonstrate the ability of the widget to pull information from other websites through their API (Application Interface).    

# Install
Download this repo as a zip and install like any other WP plugin

# Setup
Upon adding a My Zmanim Widget to your site you'll have the option to enter the title of your widget, username (to My Zmanim), password/key (to My Zmanim), and time zone (for My Zmanim.  If you don't know it just leave it as the default of -5.0).  
Enter your personal information and click 'save'.  Now youâ€™re ready to enter as many comments as you want!

# Usage
* After saving your "My Zmanim" name and key, you can enter your first comment.  
* To add your next comment, click on "Add New".  To view or edit a previous comment, click on "Edit Previous" etc.  
* Be sure to save your changes before clicking to a different comment. 


# Dependencies
My Zmanim API needs files "php_soap.dll" and "php_openssl.dll" they may need to be enabled in the php.ini by your server systems administrator.

# Credits
* The text input and output functionality of the widget was implemented based on a plugin named "Example Widget Plugin" written by Jon Penland (See https://github.com/jpen365/example-widget-plugin/releases/tag/1.0 for its source code or accesses it from the "sources" folder of the repository in example-widget-plugin.php.)

* The API call to My Zmanim was based on the example I downloaded from their website: https://www.myzmanim.com/apidemo.aspx.  Or access it from the sources folder of the repository in Example.php.
