# My Zmanim Widget
This is a WordPress plugin that will allow the admin to enter comments to appear on the user page.  Each comment includes a zman which is selected by the admin.
For Example "Today Shachris will be at (Sunrise).  
             Brachos will start 30 minutes beforehand."

I wrote this plugin as an exercise creating wordpress widget that accepts a variable number of input comments from the admin and displays them to the end user.  I also wanted to demonstrate the ability of the widget to pull information from other websites through their API (Application Interface).    

# Install
Download this repo as a zip and install like any other WP plugin

# Setup
1. Go To the the "Admin Dashboard".  Then select the "My Zmanim login info" screen under the   "Settings" Menu.
2. Enter your user Id and Key.  clicking "save" will cause your information to be validated and saved to the database.  Repeat untill the validation is successful.
3. Add a My Zmanim Widget to your site. Now youâ€™re ready to enter as many comments as you want!

# Credits
* The text input and output functionality of the widget was implemented based on a plugin named "Example Widget Plugin" written by Jon Penland (See https://github.com/jpen365/example-widget-plugin/releases/tag/1.0 for its source code or accesses it from the "sources" folder of the repository in example-widget-plugin.php.)

* The API call to My Zmanim was based on the example I downloaded from their website: https://www.myzmanim.com/apidemo.aspx.  Or access it from the sources folder of the repository in Example.php.
